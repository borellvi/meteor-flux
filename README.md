#Meteor Vibe
## Example application using Flux and Meteor.

If you want to run it locally you will have to request a new client_id in http://soundcloud.com/you/apps/new and paste it client/services/SoundCloudService.js and main.js.

After that you will have to run:
```
npm install
meteor update --release 1.3-modules-beta.4
meteor
```
